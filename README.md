How to play:
- In a game of Texas hold'em, each player is dealt two cards face down (the 'hole cards')
- Over several betting rounds, five more cards are (eventually) dealt face up in the middle of the table
- Players can use each round to bet additional chips or fold
- Check passes your action without raising or folding if there is no active bet.
- Call calls the current bet.
- Raise raises the current bet.
- Fold throws your hand away. 
- To Input actions, simply type them into the terminal (ex. "check", "call", "raise")
- The game ends when the player or all CPU opponents reach zero chips at the end of a hand
- To win, take all opponent's chips
