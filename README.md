2 Card Texas Holdem Poker application that runs inside the command prompt/terminal.  Compile and run "Poker.cpp" in the same way as any other C++ application.

How to play: (For Final Build)
- In a game of Texas hold'em, each player is dealt two cards face down (the 'hole cards')
- Over several betting rounds, five more cards are (eventually) dealt face up in the middle of the table
- Players can use each round to bet additional chips or fold
- To Input actions, simply type them into the terminal (ex. "check", "call", "raise")
- The game ends when the player or all CPU opponents reach zero chips at the end of a hand
- To win, take all opponent's chips
